      <h2>some of our pizzas</h2>
      <h3><em>margherita pizza</em></h3>
      <p>
        Everyone loves pizza, and we’re starting off this awesome list with a
        margherita pizza that you can make in a skillet. It’s filled with fresh
        mozzarella, ripe tomatoes, and basil leaves. It’s also got a perfect
        crispy golden crust!
        <strong>ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>▢1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
        <li>▢1 pound pizza dough, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>▢½ cup tomato sauce, or pizza sauce</li>
        <li>▢4 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, cut into 8 slices</li>
        <li>▢2 ripe tomatoes, cocktail, Campari, or Roma, about ten ¼" thick slices</li>
        <li>▢10 fresh basil leaves</li>
        <li>▢kosher salt, as needed for seasoning</li>
        <li>▢black pepper, as needed for seasoning</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Preheat the Oven</i></b> – If using store-bought pizza dough, allow it to sit at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes. Place the oven rack in the center position and preheat to 475ºF (246ºC).
            <li><b><i>Warm the Pan</i></b> – Place a 12-inch cast iron skillet in the oven to heat.</li>
            <li><b><i>Roll Out the Dough</i></b> – Lightly flour a work surface, the dough, and the rolling pin. Roll out into a 12-inch circle.</li>
            <li><b><i>Grease the Pan</i></b> – Carefully remove the skillet from the oven and place it on a heat-safe surface. Add olive oil to the skillet and use a paper towel to evenly spread into the pan.</li>
            <li><b><i>Par-Bake the Crust</i></b> – Carefully add the pizza dough to the hot skillet, spreading the edges into the corners. Lightly brush olive oil on the edges of the crust. Bake for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li><b><i>Add the Toppings</i></b> – Remove from the oven and evenly spread the pizza sauce over the dough. Place the cheese evenly on top of the sauce. Place the tomatoes evenly over the cheese.</li>
            <li><b><i>Bake</i></b> – Bake the pizza until the bottom is golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li><b><i>To Serve</i></b> – Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place basil leaves evenly across the top. Slice on a cutting board and enjoy hot.</li>
            </li>
        </ol></li>
      </p>
      <h3><em>Chicken Pesto Pizza</em></h3>
      <p>
        Try something new on your next family pizza night. Instead of a meat lover’s pizza with traditional tomato sauce, add a fresh basil pesto to season the crust. The aromatic herbs, garlic, cheese, and nuts add a gourmet flavor. Super sweet and juicy tomatoes add that missing tomato sauce element and complement the garden-inspired ingredients.

If you have leftover roasted chicken, this is a great way to use it on a new meal. Just shred the meat up. Freshly grated mozzarella cheese locks all the ingredients together when melted. I sprinkle a little parmesan right before serving to add a pleasant saltiness.
        <br><strong>ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>▢1 pound pizza dough</li>
        <li>▢olive oil, for brushing</li>
        <li>▢2 teaspoons cornmeal, optional</li>
        <li>▢½ cup pesto sauce</li>
        <li>▢2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>▢1 cup cooked shredded chicken</li>
        <li>▢1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved lengthwise</li>
        <li>▢½ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>▢½ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>▢1 tablespoon grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>▢1 tablespoon pine nuts, toasted</li>
        <li>▢1 tablespoon sliced basil</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Preheat the Oven</i></b> – Set the oven rack to the lowest position and set the temperature to 500ºF (260ºC).
            <li><b><i>Warm the Pan</i></b> – Allow the prepared pizza dough to sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li><b><i>Prepare the Pan</i></b> –Lightly brush a large baking sheet with olive oil. Evenly sprinkle cornmeal on the pan, if desired.</li>
            <li><b><i>Shape the Dough</i></b> –  On a lightly floured surface, stretch and shape the dough into a 10-inch circle—transfer to the baking sheet. Use fingers to press into a 12-inch circle.
                Leave the edges slightly thicker, about ½-inch tall and wide. Brush olive oil on the edges to make the crust crispier when baked.</li>
            <li><b><i>Add the Toppings </i></b> – Spread on the pesto first, followed by mozzarella cheese, chicken, and tomatoes. Evenly sprinkle with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><b><i>Bake</i></b> – Cook until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
            <li><b><i>Serve</i></b> – Garnish with parmesan cheese, pine nuts, and basil. Slice and serve immediately while still hot.</li>
            </li>
        </ol>

      <h3><em>BBQ Chicken Pizza</em></h3>
      <p>
        No restaurant pizza compares to this easy homemade BBQ Chicken Pizza made with bbq sauce, mozzarella, chicken, red onions and cilantro on perfect homemade pizza crust.
        What’s your favorite type of pizza?  BBQ chicken might just be it for me, though I do love traditional Pepperoni and sometimes I’m in the mood to liven things up with Garlic Ranch Chicken or Loaded Jalepeno Popper Pizza.  My kids love getting involved in the pizza making process and it’s a fun activity for our family on the weekend. If we’re really ambitious we will even make homemade bbq sauce.
       <br> <strong>ingredients:</strong>
        <ul>
        <li>▢Dough for one large pizza</li>
        <li>▢1 1/2 cups cooked chicken , shredded rotisserie or about 2 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>▢2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>▢1/2 cup barbecue sauce</li>
        <li>▢1/4 large red onion very thinly sliced</li>
        <li>▢fresh cilantro to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <strong>instructions:</strong>
        <ol>
            <li><b><i>Preheat your oven</i></b> to 450 degrees F and prebake your pizza dough for 6 minutes.
            <li><b><i>Spread</i></b> a thin layer of bbq sauce on top of the pre-baked pizza crust. Then top with a thin layer of mozzarella cheese and sliced red onion. </li>
            <li><b><i>Add</i></b> shredded rotisserie chicken to a bowl and cover it with a few tablespoons of bbq sauce. Toss to combine. Spread chicken pieces over the pizza. </li>
            <li><b><i>Sprinkle </i></b> another thin layer of cheese on top of the pizza, and add chopped cilantro, to taste. </li>
            <li><b><i>Bake</i></b> at 450 F for 10 -15 minutes or until crust is golden brown and cheese is bubbly.</li>
            </li>
        </ol></li>

      <h3><em>Spicy Sausage Pizza</em></h3>
      <p>
        The crust is made using my tried and true homemade crust recipe. It gets topped with loads of spicy sausage, sweet peppers, onions, chili oil, crushed red pepper, and mozzarella cheese. It just may be the best spicy pizza out there. If you are looking for something different, give this pizza a try!

        We are taking a break from sweets today and focusing on another one of my beloved favorites, PIZZA!!
        
        We all know how delicious this carby meal is and I’m excited to share my latest version.
        
        Today’s spicy sausage pizza is a real kicker. It puts fire on the taste buds.
        
        If you are not a fan of spicy food, I’m sorry to say, this pizza is not for you. You may want to try my bbq chicken pizza instead!
